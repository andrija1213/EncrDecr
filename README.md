EncrDecr is my little software made in C++ that I made for encrpyting files.<br>
It uses simple XOR encryption by key you enter.<br>
It's single threaded and it's very simple, I may optimize it in the future.<br>
Usage is: ./encrdecr *key* *source file to be encrypted* *destination file*<br>
It's best to put it in /usr/bin on Linux so you can use it in terminal as a normal command(I am not sure about Windows)<br>
On Linux, after putting it in /usr/bin, cd into your file directory and use the command
